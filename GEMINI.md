- Base development on the requirement definition files found in the `.kiro/` directory, which were defined by the Kiro AI agent.
- When starting a new task defined in `.kiro/specs/timecard-service/tasks.md`, use the `gh` command to check for a corresponding GitHub Issue. If no match is found, confirm with the user before proceeding.
- Keep commits granular. Each commit should represent a single, meaningful unit of work (e.g., a feature addition, a bug fix).
- All responses to the user must be in Japanese.
